"""The persistent fill ledger (fill_record) — ingest, dedupe, load.

Open lots + completed trades are PROJECTIONS of this ledger (see rebuild.py);
this module owns the durable source of truth. Three jobs:

  1. upsert_api_fills()  — persist every fill the Schwab API returns, idempotently
     (unique fill_key). An API fill REPLACES a matching CSV fill (same day-key) —
     upgrading it to full fidelity (real timestamp + order id).
  2. import_csv_fills()  — persist Buy/Sell rows from a Schwab Transactions CSV
     export, skipping rows the ledger already knows (from either source).
  3. load_fills()        — the full merged history as reconstruct.Fill objects,
     datetimes normalized to naive UTC so the chronological sort can never crash.

Cross-source identity: day-level MULTISET matching on (trade_date, symbol, side,
shares, price) — two identical trades on the same day are two distinct fills, so
we count occurrences per key rather than treating the key as unique.
