"""Non-blocking sanity checks for a strategy config.

The Rules tab lets the user edit freely — including into states that are legal to
save but probably not intended (a ladder that doesn't get deeper, sizing that shrinks
with depth, a deployment tier at >100%). This surfaces those as advisory findings; it
NEVER blocks saving. Pure + defensive (tolerates missing/partial keys) so it can be
unit-tested and run on any mapping shape from `StrategyConfig.to_mapping()`.
