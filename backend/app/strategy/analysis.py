"""Pure 'method health' analytics for the LIFO progressive ladder.

Read-only risk lenses over the CURRENT book and the realized trade record. No I/O:
callers pass plain position facts / trade stats + a StrategyConfig; these return
JSON-ready dicts, so everything is trivially unit-testable (like rules.py).

Everything here is ADVISORY. The ladder itself has no stop and no sell-the-loser
rule — its failure mode lives in the tail (a name that keeps falling while the
biggest lots go in). These functions exist to make that tail *visible*:
  - concentration_by_underlying: true single-name exposure (stock + its leveraged ETFs)
  - ladder_stress: mark-to-market at further drops (the downside the ladder walks into)
  - thesis_break: names behaving like a broken thesis the ladder would just keep buying
  - kelly_sizing: whether the fixed $ tiers are sane vs the account's own win/loss record
They recommend nothing automatically and place no orders.
