"""Ledger service — the "Bal. Info" port.

Built from the verified spec (scratchpad/bal_info_spec.md) and validated against
the real DB. Realized P&L comes from completed_trade; open exposure from lot.

The original sheet has several bugs (a tax cascade that collapses to a flat 12%,
month buckets that straddle calendar boundaries, a "Gross Sales" column that is
really cost basis, an annualization anchored 13 months before any trade). We
compute the CORRECT values and also surface the sheet-parity numbers so the
user can see both. Anything needing a real account-balance series (daily
balance, total gain/loss, "reg trading") is flagged blocked until daily_balance
snapshots accrue.

This package is a drop-in replacement for the old single-module app/ledger.py:
every name that module exposed is re-exported here, so `from app import ledger`
and `from app.ledger import X` keep working unchanged.
