"""ETF -> underlying grouping.

Single-stock leveraged/inverse ETFs (e.g. "Tradr 2X Long QBTS Daily ETF",
"DEFIANCE DAILY TARGET 2X LONG RCAT ETF") embed their underlying ticker right in
the fund name. We detect that link so the dashboard can nest the ETF under its
underlying stock — decisions about the ETF lean on the underlying's direction
(e.g. its % of 52-week high).

Pure + dependency-free (unit-tested). Auto-detection is best-effort (needs the
name, which enrichment may not have filled yet); a per-account manual override
(see ledger.get_etf_links) is the authoritative fallback.
