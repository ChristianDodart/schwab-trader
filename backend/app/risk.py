"""Ticker risk classification — a coarse "how dangerous is this instrument" band used to
color-code the symbol across the app (blue = safer, red = riskier).

Pure + dependency-free (unit-tested). Heuristic, from data we already store on the Ticker
(name, industry, market cap) — no extra fetch, no schema change:
  - low       broad ETF/fund, or large-cap stock (>= $10B)          → blue
  - medium    mid-cap stock ($2B–$10B), or unknown                  → neutral
  - elevated  small-cap ($300M–$2B)                                 → amber
  - high      leveraged/inverse ETF, or micro-cap (< $300M)         → red
