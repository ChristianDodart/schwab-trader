"""Rebuild an account's open lots + completed trades from Schwab, reconciled to truth.

Schwab is the source of truth. Two Schwab inputs combine:
  - FILLS (filled orders) → LIFO reconstruction → the per-rung ladder + closed trades.
  - POSITIONS (current holdings) → the authoritative CURRENT quantity per symbol.
We reconstruct the ladder from fills, then RECONCILE it against live positions so
each symbol's open total always equals what Schwab says you hold — recovering any
shares whose buys fall outside the fill window (or aren't exposed at all, e.g. a
managed account) as a backfilled `source=position` lot.

Safety (a rebuild WIPES then re-inserts, scoped to the account) — a wipe may only
proceed on TRUSTWORTHY inputs; an empty/partial read is never trusted to delete data:
  - fills FETCH FAILED (None) → NO-OP. Never flatten a good ladder on a transient error.
  - EMPTY positions map ({}) → treated as 'no positions' (untrustworthy as 'hold
    nothing'); reconcile is skipped so it can't zero out real holdings.
  - EMPTY fills ([]) + positions present, but the account ALREADY holds fill-derived
    data → REFUSE. Empty fills is normal for a managed account (no fills exposed) but
    an anomaly for a full-access account (its sells are fills); trusting it would wipe
    real completed trades and flatten the ladder into synthetic lots.
  - positions unavailable + no fills → NO-OP; positions unavailable + oversold → REFUSE.
  - fetch + write run inside ONE PER-ACCOUNT lock so a stale snapshot can't clobber a
    newer one, WITHOUT serializing unrelated accounts against each other.
