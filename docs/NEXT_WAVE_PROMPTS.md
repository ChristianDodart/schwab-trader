# Next-wave task prompts (for delegated execution)

> **STATUS: Wave 1 (P1–P5 below) was EXECUTED 2026-07-05 and shipped in v0.3.0.** Kept
> here for reference. The **live queue is "Wave 2" at the bottom of this file.**

Five self-contained tasks, designed 2026-07-05. Each prompt below can be handed to a
separate session/model verbatim. They are ordered by value; they do not depend on each
other unless noted.

**Rules that apply to EVERY task (paste along with the prompt):**

> - Read `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root first — it's the project brain. Obey its
>   maintenance rules and update it when you finish (edit lines, don't append history).
> - Repo: `C:\Users\dodar\projects\schwab-trader`. Backend = Python/FastAPI in
>   `backend/` (run tests: `cd backend && .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/ -q`
>   — 57 pass today). Frontend = React/TS/Vite in `frontend/` (verify:
>   `npx tsc --noEmit` then `npx vite build`). Do not ship with either failing.
> - **NEVER touch money-path logic** (`orders.place_order` guards, `bulk.py` rails,
>   sell/oversell/PDT/fat-finger checks) unless the task explicitly says so. Display
>   layers may READ anything.
> - **Design system:** colors/spacing ONLY via CSS vars from `frontend/src/tokens.css`
>   (`--pos`/`--neg` for money, `--accent` = controls, text tiers `--text/-muted/-dim/-faint`);
>   reuse primitives from `ui.css` (`.btn*`, `.panel`, `.tbl`, `.pill`, `.field`) and
>   patterns from existing components. Errors via `useToast()`, never `alert()`.
>   "Only surface exceptions": don't add always-on green/OK indicators.
> - The dev Schwab token may be dead (shows "Not live") — that's environmental, not
>   your bug. Anything needing live Schwab data should degrade gracefully.
> - When done: run backend tests + tsc + vite build, update `CLAUDE.md` (one tight
>   bullet), and do NOT rebuild the installer (the maintainer batches that).

## P1 — Trade journal & performance analytics (Ledger → "Trades" sub-tab)

**Goal.** The app records every closed round-trip (`completed_trade` table) but has no
per-trade view — the old Google Sheet's "Long Log" was exactly this and it's the biggest
remaining feature gap. Build a **Trades** sub-tab under Ledger showing the full trade
log + performance analytics.

**Backend** (new endpoint in `backend/app/main.py` + logic in `backend/app/ledger.py`):
- `GET /api/ledger/trades?start=&end=&symbol=` → for the SELECTED account (use
  `await _selected()` like the other ledger endpoints):
  - `trades`: list of completed trades, newest first — `{id, symbol, shares, buy_price,
    sell_price, cost, profit, opened_at, completed_at, hold_days (completed−opened, None
    if opened_at is null), is_day_trade (opened_at == completed_at)}`.
  - `summary`: `{count, wins, losses, win_rate, total_profit, avg_win, avg_loss,
    profit_factor (gross wins ÷ |gross losses|, None if no losses), avg_hold_days,
    day_trade_count, best {symbol, profit}, worst {symbol, profit}}`.
  - `by_symbol`: per-symbol rollup `{symbol, count, total_profit, win_rate}` sorted by
    total_profit desc.
  - All computed in Python from one query (the table is small); guard divide-by-zero.
- Follow the existing style in `ledger.py` (`_f()` float casts, scoped `account_hash`
  conditions, `_parse_date` for start/end).

**Frontend** (`frontend/src/LedgerTrades.tsx`, wired into `Ledger.tsx`):
- Add a third `SubTabs` entry: Historic / Predictive / **Trades** (see `Ledger.tsx` —
  the SubTabs component + `${tab}-panel` tabpanel pattern already exist; extend the
  union type).
- Layout: summary cards on top (use `Card` from `LedgerUI.tsx`): Win rate (e.g. "68% ·
  34W/16L"), Total P/L (colored via `moneyColor`), Profit factor, Avg hold. Then a
  `PeriodSelector` (already in `LedgerUI.tsx`) + optional symbol filter (text input).
  Then the trades table (`.tbl`): Date closed · Symbol · Shares · Buy · Sell · P/L
  (colored, signed) · Held (e.g. "3d", "same day" chip when is_day_trade) · . Then a
  compact "By symbol" table.
- Empty state: friendly text ("No closed trades in this period.").
- Loading: reuse `SkeletonCards`/`SkeletonPanel` from `Skeleton.tsx`.
- Add types to `types.ts`.

**Acceptance:** tab renders with real data for the selected account (the dev DB has
11+ completed trades); switching period/symbol filters correctly; win_rate/profit_factor
math verified by a small pytest (`tests/test_trade_stats.py`) against a hand-computed
fixture; tsc + build + all tests green.

---

## P2 — Diagnostics & About panel (Settings)

**Goal.** Surface "what build am I running / is everything healthy" in one place.
The backend already exposes everything needed: `GET /api/version` (`{version, data_dir}`),
`GET /health` (`{status, version, database, stream_mode}`), `GET /api/auth/status`
(liveness: `verified_live`, `last_checked_ago_s`, `latency_ms`, `check_source`),
`GET /api/backups` (`{dir, db_bytes, keep, backups[]}`), `GET /api/fmp-status`.

**Build** a "About & diagnostics" `Section` at the BOTTOM of `frontend/src/Settings.tsx`
(follow the existing Section/Field pattern in that file):
- App version (big-ish, `Schwab Trader v0.2.0`), data directory path (code style,
  word-break), database size (MB).
- A small status grid: Database (from /health `database`), Schwab API (from auth/status:
  "Live · verified Ns ago · Xms" green, or the failure message amber/red),
  Quote stream (`stream_mode`: schwab=Live / reauth=Offline / demo=Demo / starting=Connecting),
  Company data (FMP configured ✓/—), Last backup (from /api/backups).
- A "Copy diagnostics" button that copies a plain-text block of all the above to the
  clipboard (for pasting into a support conversation).
- Poll nothing aggressively — fetch once on mount + a manual "Refresh" button.
- Do NOT duplicate the backup controls (the "Data & backups" section already exists) —
  link the eye to it with a one-line mention instead.

**Acceptance:** section renders with real values; degraded states readable (kill the
token → Schwab row shows the failure); tsc + vite build green.

---

## P3 — Orders tab polish (live refresh + working-order visibility)

**Goal.** The Orders tab is a static list; working orders deserve ambient visibility.

1. **Auto-refresh:** `frontend/src/Orders.tsx` — refetch the list every 15s while the
   tab is visible (clear the interval on unmount; guard out-of-order responses with an
   `alive` flag like `Screener.tsx` does). Keep the manual refresh button if present.
2. **Status chips:** render order status as a colored chip (reuse `.pill`):
   WORKING/QUEUED/ACCEPTED/PENDING_ACTIVATION → amber; FILLED → green (`--pos`);
   CANCELED/REJECTED/EXPIRED → dim (`--text-faint`). Keep the raw text inside the chip.
3. **Nav badge:** show a small count of WORKING-ish orders on the "Orders" nav tab
   (App.tsx `NAV` render) — e.g. "Orders ·2". Backend: add `GET /api/orders/working-count`
   in `main.py` delegating to a new `orders.working_count()` that reuses the existing
   `list_orders` fetch and counts statuses in {WORKING, QUEUED, ACCEPTED,
   PENDING_ACTIVATION} — READ-ONLY, do not touch place/cancel logic. Poll it in App.tsx
   every 60s; hide the badge at 0 (only-surface-exceptions).
4. Do NOT add any bulk-cancel button (money-path; out of scope).

**Acceptance:** chips render for the real order history on the dev DB; badge appears
only when a working order exists (can be simulated by temporarily returning a fake
count locally — do not place real orders); intervals cleaned up (no leaks on tab
switch); tsc + build + tests green.

---

## P4 — Frontend test harness (vitest) + pure-logic tests

**Goal.** The frontend has ZERO tests. Stand up vitest and cover the pure logic that
guards real behavior. NO component/DOM tests in this pass (no jsdom complexity) —
pure functions only.

1. `cd frontend && npm i -D vitest` ; add `"test": "vitest run"` to package.json
   scripts; create `vitest.config.ts` (node environment is fine for pure logic).
2. Extract-and-test (move functions into small exported helpers where needed, WITHOUT
   changing behavior — keep the same imports working):
   - `columns.tsx`: the `sanitize` logic inside `useColumnPrefs` (extract to an exported
     `sanitizeColumnIds(arr, validIds)` used by the hook) — test: drops unknown ids,
     de-dupes preserving order, honors explicitly-empty, returns null on corrupt input.
   - `FinancialRules.tsx`: `sizingSentence` (export it) — test the rung-range wording;
     and the ladder-preview math (extract `ladderPreviewRows(drops, maxRungs)` returning
     `{rung, price, drop}[]` from `LadderPreview`'s useMemo) — test tier boundaries
     (rung 2 = 10%, rungs 3+ pick the right drop, caps at 6 rows shown).
   - `Screener.tsx`: `fmtVol` and `fmtCap` (already module-level) — test the B/M/K
     thresholds and null handling.
3. Keep every extraction a pure move (same behavior); run `npx tsc --noEmit`,
   `npx vite build`, AND the new `npm test` — all green.

**Acceptance:** `npm test` runs ≥12 assertions across ≥3 files and passes; build
unchanged; no component behavior changed (extractions only).

---

## P5 — Small-fixes bundle (three independent items)

1. **Session dropdown gated by order type** (`frontend/src/OrderTicket.tsx`): Schwab
   rejects MARKET orders in AM/PM sessions. When order type is MARKET (or STOP/
   TRAILING_STOP — anything that becomes a market order), restrict the Session select
   to NORMAL (disable/hide AM/PM/SEAMLESS options and force value NORMAL if currently
   invalid). LIMIT/STOP_LIMIT keep all sessions. Don't touch the server.
2. **Skip pointless nightly fills-probes for no-fills accounts** (`backend/app/rebuild.py`
   area): the managed LLC account exposes NO fills, but every nightly sync still pages
   7 empty `get_orders` windows. Cache a per-account "exposes_fills" hint in
   `app_setting` (key `fills_capable:{account_hash}`, value "0"/"1"): set "0" after a
   sync where fills came back genuinely EMPTY (not None/error) AND the account has no
   fill-derived data (`_has_fill_derived_data()` false); set "1" whenever any fill is
   seen. When the hint is "0", `resync_account` may skip the fills fetch and go straight
   to positions mirroring — BUT still do a full fills probe once every 7 days (store
   last-probe date in the same setting, e.g. "0:2026-07-05") so a newly-enabled account
   is eventually rediscovered. SAFETY: any doubt → probe (default to probing). Add a
   pytest for the hint parse/refresh logic (pure helper).
3. **Audit-log retention** (`backend/app/notifications.py` or a small helper): the
   `audit_event` table grows forever. In the nightly snapshot scheduler (or a similar
   existing daily hook), delete audit rows older than 180 days AND beyond the newest
   5,000 (both conditions must hold — keep at least 5k rows regardless of age). Log
   how many were pruned. Add a pytest with an in-memory session if the test harness
   supports it, else a pure date-cutoff helper test.

**Acceptance:** each item verified as described; 57+ backend tests still pass; tsc +
build green; CLAUDE.md updated with one bullet per item.

# WAVE 2 — EXECUTED 2026-07-05, shipped v0.4.0

> W2-2..W2-5 done and verified. **W2-1 auto-updater is BLOCKED** — no git repo exists
> yet; wiring is done (`build-installer.ps1 -Publish`) but needs the maintainer to
> `git init`, create a GitHub repo, and fill `desktop/package.json` build.publish. Once
> that's set, W2-1's in-app "check for updates" UI is the only remaining piece.

(original prompts kept below for reference)

# WAVE 2 — live queue (designed 2026-07-05)

Same shared-rules header as Wave 1 applies (read CLAUDE.md; never touch money-path
logic unless told; design-system + toast rules; verify backend `pytest` + `npm test` +
`tsc` + `vite build`; do NOT rebuild the installer — that's batched via
`build-installer.ps1`). Ordered by value.

## W2-1 — Auto-updater wiring (finish the distribution story)

**Goal.** The Electron app already bundles `electron-updater` and builds a `latest.yml`,
but `desktop/package.json` `build.publish` still has `REPLACE_WITH_GH_OWNER/REPO`, so
silent updates don't work. Wire it to a real GitHub repo so a `build-installer.ps1`
release actually pushes an update non-tech users receive automatically.

- Ask the maintainer for the GitHub owner/repo (or read it from the git remote:
  `git -C <repo> remote get-url origin`). Fill `build.publish[0].owner`/`repo`.
- Add a `release` path to `build-installer.ps1` (a `-Publish` switch → `electron-builder
  --publish always`, requires `GH_TOKEN` in the env — document this in the script header
  and `desktop/README.md`).
- In-app: add an **"Updates" row** to the Settings "About & diagnostics" panel showing
  the current version + a "Check for updates" button that asks the Electron main process
  (via a new `preload.js` bridge `window.desktop.checkForUpdates()` →
  `ipcMain.handle` → `autoUpdater.checkForUpdatesAndNotify()`), and surfaces
  update-available / downloading / ready states. Guard everything on
  `window.desktop?.isDesktop` (dev browser shows "desktop app only").
- **Acceptance:** package.json has a real repo; `-Publish` documented; the Settings
  updates row renders in-app and no-ops gracefully in the browser. (Actual GitHub
  release upload needs the maintainer's token — don't attempt it, just wire it.)

## W2-2 — "Rules health" checks on the Financial Rules tab

**Goal.** The Rules tab lets you edit the strategy freely — including into nonsensical
states (drops that don't increase with depth, sizing tiers with gaps, a deployment
tier at >100%). Add a **non-blocking validation panel** that surfaces suspicious config.

- Pure backend helper `strategy.validate.check(cfg_mapping) -> list[{level, message}]`
  (level = "warn"|"info"). Checks: ladder drops non-monotonic vs rung depth; sizing
  tiers with a gap or non-ascending dollars; `max_rungs` < deepest tier; deployment
  tiers not descending / a `min_deployed_pct` >100 or `drop_multiplier` <1; sell
  `pct_above` <=0; universe `market_cap_min` >= `market_cap_max`. Pure + unit-tested.
- `GET /api/strategy/validate` runs it on the SELECTED account's config.
- Frontend: a subtle panel at the top of `FinancialRules.tsx` listing any findings
  (amber for warn), or a quiet "✓ Rules look consistent" when clean. Re-run on save.
- **Acceptance:** feed it a deliberately broken config → the right warnings; clean
  config → the ok state; pure checker unit-tested; never blocks saving (advisory only).

## W2-3 — Dashboard totals footer

**Goal.** The dashboard table has per-row numbers but no bottom-line. Add a **totals
row** (or footer band) summing the meaningful columns for the visible held positions:
total Invested, total Market value, total Unrealized P/L (colored), total Day P/L,
and total Harvestable — matching whatever money columns are currently shown.

- Frontend-only if the dashboard payload already carries the per-row fields (it does:
  invested, current_value, unrealized, day_change, last_pos_profit). Compute the sums
  in `DashboardTable.tsx` over `rows.filter(r => !r.is_watch)`; render a sticky `<tfoot>`
  styled distinctly (heavier top border, `--panel-2`). Respect the dynamic column set —
  only total the columns that are numeric money columns AND currently visible; blank the
  rest. Skip totals for columns where a sum is meaningless (price, %s, basis/share).
- **Acceptance:** totals match a hand sum of the visible rows; hiding/showing/reordering
  columns keeps totals under the right columns; watch rows excluded; tsc + build green.

## W2-4 — CSV export (trades + deposits)

**Goal.** Christian imports a Schwab CSV; let him get his OWN data back out (taxes,
spreadsheets, records). Add CSV export for the trade journal and the deposit log.

- Backend: `GET /api/ledger/trades.csv` and `GET /api/ledger/cashflows.csv` (reuse
  `build_trades` / `list_cashflows`), returning `text/csv` with a
  `Content-Disposition: attachment` filename incl. the account mask + date. A tiny
  shared `_rows_to_csv(headers, rows)` helper (stdlib `csv` + `io.StringIO`).
- Frontend: an "⬇ Export CSV" button on the Trades sub-tab and the deposit-log panel
  (respects the current period/symbol filter via query params — just forward them).
- **Acceptance:** files open cleanly in Excel with correct headers/values scoped to the
  current filter; no new deps; verified against the dev account's real trades.

## W2-5 — Small-fixes bundle #2

1. **Bundle chunk-size:** the vite build warns ">500 kB chunk". Add
   `build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks` in `frontend/vite.config.ts` to split
   `lightweight-charts` (and optionally react) into a separate chunk. Acceptance: build
   warning gone; app still loads (verify via preview).
2. **`get_trading_account()` clarity:** when an order is refused because the account
   isn't trading-enabled, the toast just says so. Add the account mask to the message
   ("…8719 isn't trading-enabled — enable it in Settings") so multi-account users know
   WHICH one. Backend message only; no logic change.
3. **Backup restore affordance:** the backups list is backend-only. Add a read-only
   list of recent backups (filename + date + size) under Settings "Data & backups" (from
   the existing `GET /api/backups`), each with a "Reveal in folder"-style hint text
   (`explorer /select,<path>` is NOT wired — just show the full path + a copy button).
   Acceptance: list renders newest-first; no delete/restore buttons (too dangerous to
   automate — restore stays a manual file swap, documented).

# WAVE 3 — EXECUTED 2026-07-05, shipped v0.5.0

- **W3-1 Strategy-trigger notifications** — `strategy_triggers.py` watcher pushes a bell+desktop
  alert when a held position crosses its next-buy trigger or a sell target (edge-detected,
  reuses build_dashboard marks). Advisory only.
- **W3-2 Equity curve** — `EquityCurve.tsx` charts the nightly daily_balance `series` on Ledger→Historic.

# WAVE 4 — EXECUTED 2026-07-05, shipped v0.6.0

- **W4-1 Chart overlays** — `PriceChart` draws projected ladder-rung triggers (dashed) + 52wk avg/median
  (dotted) via `createPriceLine`; overlay managed apart from the candle stream (no rebuild on price tick).
  Backend `build_position_detail` now returns `avg_52wk`/`median_52wk`.
- **W4-2 Buying-power awareness** — `suggest_buy` + `bulk buy_plan` return `buying_power` (+ `affordable`);
  OrderTicket & BulkReviewModal show a soft "exceeds buying power" note. ADVISORY, never blocks.
- **W4-3 Phone reach** — `phone.py` optional ntfy.sh / SMTP channel (Fernet-encrypted), fired from the three
  loud emitters (resting fills, strategy triggers, price alerts) via `dispatch`; Settings panel + test button.
- **W4-4 XIRR** — pure `xirr.py` (Newton + bisection fallback) + 8 unit tests; `build_historic` adds `xirr_pct`;
  "Since inception" card on Ledger→Historic (deposited / value / gain+ROI / annualized XIRR).
- **W4-5 Small fixes #3** — dashboard dims + "prices may be stale" note when not live (reuses verified_live via
  `useLiveness`); cumulative-P/L sparkline on the Trades sub-tab; Screener remembers index/sort in localStorage.

# WAVE 5 — EXECUTED 2026-07-05, shipped v0.7.0

- **W5-1 In-app update banner** — `main.js` forwards electron-updater `update-available/downloaded/error`
  through the preload bridge; `UpdateBanner.tsx` shows the new version + patch notes + a one-click
  "Restart & update" (quitAndInstall) with a plain "or relaunch later" note. No-op on web.
- **W5-2 CHANGELOG + release-notes automation** — `CHANGELOG.md` holds fun per-version notes;
  `build-installer.ps1 -Publish` extracts the version's section, appends a standard "how to update"
  footer, sets it as the GitHub release body, and flips the draft to published (one source of truth →
  web release page AND the in-app banner via electron-updater's releaseNotes).
- **W5-3 SPY benchmark** — pure `benchmark.py` (`simulate` buy-and-hold over the account's own dated
  contributions) + 7 unit tests; `market_data` gained a "5Y" range; `ledger.build_benchmark` +
  `/api/ledger/benchmark`; an "If it were all SPY" card on the since-inception block, tinted by whether
  the active strategy is ahead of / behind the index. Fails soft (card hides) when history is short.

# WAVE 6 — EXECUTED 2026-07-05, shipped v0.8.0

- **W6-1 "What's new" viewer + update toast** — `CHANGELOG.md` bundled into the frontend via Vite `?raw`
  (`changelog.ts` parses per-version sections); a "What's new" panel in Settings shows the running
  version (expandable to older ones); a one-time "you're now on vX" toast compares `/api/version` to a
  localStorage `lastSeenVersion`.
- **W6-2 Benchmark polish** — pickable benchmark ticker (Settings → Benchmark, `benchmark_symbol` in
  app_setting, `/api/benchmark-symbol`); `build_benchmark` cached per (account, symbol) for 5 min so the
  Ledger view doesn't refetch 5Y history on every scope change. (Equity-curve overlay deferred → W7.)
- **W6-3 Keyboard shortcuts** — global keydown: digits 1..N switch tabs (through the dirty-settings
  guard), "?" toggles a help overlay; ignored while typing or when a modal is open.
- **W6-4 Small fixes #4** — OrderTicket remembers the last-used duration per session (type stays
  session-aware for safety); notifications bell pops on a new unread; compact sector-exposure strip on
  the dashboard (`SectorStrip.tsx`) from sector tags + market values.

# WAVE 7 — EXECUTED 2026-07-05, shipped v0.9.0

- **W7-1 Benchmark line on the equity curve** — pure `benchmark.value_series` (+3 tests) marks the
  benchmark position to each close; `build_benchmark` returns a `series`; `EquityCurve` overlays a
  dashed gold line with a legend. Single line when history is short.
- **W7-2 Sector concentration guardrail** — `SectorStrip` flags the biggest named sector when it exceeds
  a localStorage threshold (default 40%, inline control); tints the segment/chip + an advisory note.
- **W7-3 Tax-lot CSV** — `/api/ledger/tax-lots.csv?year=` emits acquired/sold dates, proceeds, cost
  basis, gain/loss, short/long-term; Trades tab has a year picker + "Tax" button.
- **W7-4 Realized/unrealized split** — `build_position_detail` adds `realized` (summed round-trips) +
  `unrealized` (mark-to-market); PositionDetail shows both as header stats.

# WAVE 8 — EXECUTED 2026-07-05, shipped v0.10.0

- **W8-1 Quick symbol jump** — "/" focuses a ticker filter on the dashboard (App keydown + `symInputRef`);
  narrows the table (SectorStrip/bulk keep the full row set); Escape clears.
- **W8-2 Screener filter chips** — candidates payload now returns a `filters` summary (cap band, country,
  excluded sectors, no-ETF); `FilterChips` renders them read-only with a pointer to Rules.
- **W8-4 Small fixes #6** — EquityCurve range switch (3M/1Y/All, client-side slice); click a SectorStrip
  chip to filter the table to that sector (removable); Orders tab working/filled/other tally.
- **W8-3 DEFERRED → W9-1** — dividend tracking needs a schema migration + live Schwab transaction parsing
  that can't be verified against the running DB; moved to Wave 9 to do carefully.

# WAVE 9 — EXECUTED 2026-07-05, shipped v0.11.0

- **W9-1 Dividend / income tracking** — pure `dividends.py` (parse + idempotent merge + summarize) + 7
  tests; `accounts.fetch_dividends` mirrors the verified transfer pull; stored as JSON in app_setting
  (NO migration — dividends stay out of cash_flow so the ROI/deposit base is untouched);
  `/api/ledger/dividends` + `/refresh`; "Dividends & income" panel on the Ledger with all-time + YTD
  totals, a per-payment list, and a Pull-from-Schwab button.
- **W9-2 folded in** — rather than a separate "total return" card (dividends are already in account value →
  would double-count), the income panel shows the dividend total and states plainly it's already reflected
  in returns. Honest framing beat a misleading rollup.
- **W9-4 Small fixes #7** — equity-curve range persists (localStorage); dashboard shows "showing N of M"
  when filtered; Settings "Copy support bundle" (diagnostics + log/backups paths).

# WAVE 10 — EXECUTED 2026-07-05, shipped v0.12.0

- **W10-1 Notification history search** — a filter box on the bell's feed + activity tabs (client-side over
  loaded rows) matches message or symbol.
- **W10-2 Dividend CSV import** — `is_dividend_action` (pure, tested) + `ledger.import_dividends_csv`
  (reuses the verified transfer-CSV parsing; deduped via `merge_dividends`); `/api/ledger/dividends/import`
  + an Import CSV button on the dividends panel. Covers history beyond the 60-day live pull.
- **W10-3 Per-symbol total return** — `build_position_detail` adds `dividends` (for the symbol) + a
  `total_return` (realized + unrealized + dividends); PositionDetail shows both stats.
- **W10-4 Small fixes #8** — top-payers breakdown on the dividends panel; "g"+letter vim tab jumps;
  screener "add all passing to watchlist".

# WAVE 11 — EXECUTED 2026-07-05, shipped v0.13.0

- **W11-1 Dashboard total-return column** — `build_dashboard` loads dividends once (grouped by symbol) and
  `_summary_row` returns `dividends` + `total_return` (realized + unrealized + dividends); two opt-in
  columns in the registry (watchNA for watch rows).
- **W11-2 Alert templates** — `AlertTemplates` on PositionDetail: one-click "−5% from last buy" / "above
  52wk avg" that compute the threshold from live data and POST the existing create_alert. Hidden when data
  is missing.
- **W11-3 Printable ledger summary** — a `PrintSummary` (.print-only) block + `@media print` CSS trick
  (visibility) so `window.print()` emits a clean one-pager; "Print / Save PDF" button on the Ledger.
- **W11-4 Small fixes #9** — dividends-by-year table; a "press ? for shortcuts" tip in Settings.

# WAVE 12 — EXECUTED 2026-07-05, shipped v0.14.0

- **W12-1 Break-even alert template** — "back above break-even" (threshold = basis/share) added to
  PositionDetail AlertTemplates. Dashboard-row templates deferred (would need a per-row menu → W13).
- **W12-2 Trade-journal print/PDF** — a `.print-only` closed-trades table + "Print / Save PDF" button on
  the Trades tab (reuses the global @media print CSS).
- **W12-3 Pause/resume dashboard** — a pause toggle freezes live ws updates (via `pausedRef` guard in the
  onmessage handler) + a "updates paused" chip. Configurable interval N/A (ws-push, not polling).
- **W12-4 Small fixes #10** — total_return + dividends added to the dashboard totals-footer sum set;
  notification feed grouped by day (Today / Yesterday / date).

# WAVE 13 — EXECUTED 2026-07-06, shipped v0.15.0

- **W13-2 Phone notification category prefs** — per-category toggles (price alerts / strategy triggers /
  fills) in the phone config; each `phone.dispatch` call site passes its category; `phone.send` gates on it.
  Settings checkboxes. In-app bell still gets everything. (Desktop-channel gating deferred — needs a
  notification `kind` field.)
- **W13-3 Position notes** — per-symbol free-text note stored per account in app_setting JSON (no
  migration); GET/PUT `/api/positions/{symbol}/note`; autosaving note box on PositionDetail.
- **W13-4 Small fixes #11** — pause chip shows the freeze time; screener candidate table sortable by
  Symbol / Market cap / % Chg. (Print account-name header deferred → W14.)
- **W13-1 NOT pursued** — per-row alert popover on the dashboard is marginal over the existing row bell
  (prefills the alert form) + position-detail templates; dropped to avoid low-value per-row menu UI.

# WAVE 14 — EXECUTED 2026-07-06, shipped v0.16.0

- **W14-1 Desktop notification category prefs** — `kind` (alert|trigger|fill) added to the live _push
  payload (NO migration — push-only, not stored); `fireDesktop` gates on localStorage desktop-category
  prefs; toggles in the bell's feed tab. Completes W13-2's desktop half.
- **W14-3 Note indicators** — `build_dashboard` sets `has_note` per row (from get_notes); a small dot on
  the ticker cell marks positions with a saved note.
- **W14-4 Small fixes #12** — dividend income-log CSV export (`/api/ledger/dividends.csv` + button);
  screener candidate sort persists in localStorage.
- **W14-2 DEFERRED → W15-1** — account name in print headers needs a Schwab-dependent account-label
  lookup (null in demo → unverifiable here); carried to Wave 15.
- **Notes "last edited" timestamp** — skipped (would change the notes storage shape from {sym: text} to
  {sym: {text, at}}; not worth the added handling right now).

# WAVE 15 (FIELD FEEDBACK) — EXECUTED 2026-07-06, shipped v0.17.0

Prioritized ahead of the polish queue because it came from real use.

- **FF-1 Instant dashboard refresh after a trade** — `streaming.poke_resync()` fires the fill-resync
  loop immediately; `orders.place_order` + `cancel_order` call it (bulk inherits via place_order). Frontend
  OrderTicket + BulkReviewModal POST `/api/account/sync` on a successful place for an immediate rebuild.
- **FF-3 Drill into watch tickers** — `build_position_detail` returns a watch-mode payload (is_watch, price,
  52wk, empty ladder) instead of None; PositionDetail renders a watch view (chart/notes/alerts, no ladder);
  DashboardTable lets watch rows open.
- **FF-2 Auto-watch on sell-out + last held price** — `resync_account` diffs open-lot symbols pre/post
  rebuild; sold-to-zero names get `Ticker.watch=True` and their last held price stored (app_setting JSON,
  no migration); shown on the watch tag + watch detail. Live-verified against a DB copy.

# WAVE 16 (SIGNALS & GLANCES pt.1) — EXECUTED 2026-07-06, shipped v0.18.0

From a user feature batch. Part 1 of 2 (the rest is Wave 17).

- **SIG-1 Customizable signal rules** — per-account extra rules in app_setting JSON (no migration):
  `{side, metric, op, value, color, label, enabled}`; endpoints GET/PUT `/api/signal-rules`. Pure
  client-side eval (`signals.ts`) over row metrics (last_pos_profit $, last-position gain %, LILO %).
  `rowSignalChips` renders the built-in BUY/SELL default PLUS matched custom rules as colored chips.
  Editor in Settings → Signals (default shown read-only + CRUD + color pickers). Live-verified.
- **SIG-2 Cash + buying power** — App header Cash KPI from a 30s `/api/account/margin` fetch; buying
  power (incl. margin) on hover. Hidden/degraded in demo.
- **SIG-3 Sector alert opt-in** — SectorStrip concentration alert (threshold + warning) hidden behind
  an "Alerts" toggle (localStorage, default off); the exposure bar always shows.

# WAVE 17 (SIGNALS & GLANCES pt.2) — EXECUTED 2026-07-06, shipped v0.19.0

Part 2 of 2 of the user feature batch (Wave 16 was part 1).

- **W17-1 Ticker danger-coloring** — pure `risk.py` classifier (name/industry/market_cap, optional
  authoritative `is_etf`) → low/medium/elevated/high; unit-tested (7). Surfaced as `risk` on the
  dashboard row, position detail, and screener candidate. Shared `tickerRiskColor()` + `RISK_LABEL`
  in `columns.tsx` color the symbol on DashboardTable, PositionDetail, Screener (blue/none/amber/red).
- **W17-2 To-Do sub-tab** — dashboard sub-tab bar (All / To-Do / Top 10); To-Do pre-filters rows to
  those meeting the built-in mark OR any enabled custom rule (`matchesRule`), with a live count badge.
- **W17-3 Top 10 sub-tab** — `Top10` component: top dips by lowest LILO% (buy-worthy) + top gainers by
  last-position gain% (sell-worthy), two clickable tables. No backend change.
- **W17-4 Activity view** — `build_activity(grain)` sums gross bought/sold $ + net per period from the
  fill audit log (`AuditEvent`), dialect-neutral bucketing; `GET /api/ledger/activity`. New Ledger
  "Activity" sub-tab (`LedgerActivity.tsx`) with day/week/month/year grain + period scope + flow bars.
  All live-verified against a copy of the real DB.

# WAVE 18 (GROUPING & GET-OUT) — EXECUTED 2026-07-06, shipped v0.20.0

A user feature batch + two UI fixes + a README refresh. (The older polish queue
below was NOT this wave — it rolls forward to Wave 19.)

- **W18-1 ETF grouping (nested)** — pure `grouping.py` (auto-detect underlying from a
  leveraged ETF's name against tracked symbols; unit-tested) + per-account manual
  overrides in app_setting (`etf_links`, no migration); `GET /api/etf-links`,
  `POST /api/etf-link`. Dashboard row + detail carry `underlying`/`is_leveraged`.
  `DashboardTable` nests each linked ETF as an indented child directly under its parent
  (↳ tag + the underlying's % of 52wk high); `EtfLinkEditor` in PositionDetail overrides
  it. Live-verified: RCAX→RCAT, QBTX→QBTS auto-linked and nested.
- **W18-2 Bulk Exit + rename** — `bulk.exit_plan`/`bulk_exit` (GTC limit SELL of the full
  position at last-buy price ± `exit_offset_pct`; none auto-selected; safe by limit-or-
  better + place_order's held-shares guard); `GET /api/bulk/exit-plan`, `POST /api/bulk/exit`.
  Bulk.tsx gained the "exit" kind (no order-type toggle, GTC note); buttons renamed
  **Bulk Buy / Bulk Sell / Bulk Exit**.
- **W18-3 Deployed % excludes margin** — `accounts.margin_summary` deploys vs. equity
  (own capital), so >100% now signals margin use; MarginPanel copy + red-over-100 tint.
- **W18-4 Signals UI** — read-only default rule shows the real thresholds from
  `/api/strategy` (buy-dip %, sell $/%%); metric/side `<select>`s widened (no clip).
- **W18-5 Update-banner formatting** — `cleanNotes` now converts electron-updater's
  GitHub HTML (atom feed) → readable text (block tags→newlines, li→bullets, entities);
  3 vitest cases.
- **README** rewritten for the current app (desktop/SQLite/auto-update + full feature set).
- Verified: 111 backend + 21 frontend tests, tsc + build clean; live-verified vs a DB copy.

# WAVE 19 (DATA INTEGRITY) — EXECUTED 2026-07-06, shipped v0.21.0

The data-integrity phase (see docs/DATA_INTEGRITY.md for the full plan/inventory):
- **Persistent fill ledger** — new `fill_record` table (migration `a1b2c3d4e5f6`,
  SQLite-safe) + `fill_store.py`. Every fill from any source is stored append-only;
  lots + completed trades are now a PROJECTION of it (resync upserts fresh API fills
  then projects from the FULL ledger; all rebuild trust-guards preserved).
- **Cross-source dedup** — exact fill_key idempotency per source; between sources the
  (day, symbol, side) GROUP rule: the API is complete for any group it covers, so its
  per-leg fills evict/blocks CSV per-order aggregates (partial-fill safe). Pure +
  unit-tested (7 tests).
- **One-file CSV intake** — `POST /api/data/import-csv` routes a Schwab Transactions
  export: Buy/Sell → fill ledger, transfers → deposit log, dividends/interest →
  income log (all idempotent), reports skipped actions, then `project_account()`.
- **Data health** — `GET /api/data/health`: ledger coverage/sources, projection depth,
  synthetic (position-backfilled) lots, reconstructed-vs-live share diffs, actionable
  recommendations. Settings → "Data health & import" panel with the CSV upload.
- **E2E-verified on the real account** (DB copy): migration ran on a stamped SQLite DB;
  the real 33-row CSV reconstructed holdings EXACTLY (LUNR 31/2 lots, RCAX 90, QBTS 21,
  ASTS 5), 15 realized trades, zero synthetic lots; re-import added 0.

# WAVE 20 (DATA INTEGRITY pt.2) — EXECUTED 2026-07-06, shipped v0.22.0

Hardening from Andrew's real 1,554-row export (2yr, splits/shorts/journals):
- **Reverse splits** — CSV row PAIRS (ticker +new / CUSIP -old) parsed into a SPLT
  ledger record (side "SPLT", shares=new total, price=old total; fits the 4-char
  column, no migration); `reconstruct()` rescales the open stack (basis preserved,
  zero P/L), SPLT sorts before same-day trades.
- **Short netting** — 'Sell Short' rows excluded; covering 'Buy's netted against the
  per-symbol open-short balance chronologically (canonical same-day order shorts →
  buys → sells); only the remainder becomes a long fill. Reported on import.
- **Schwab validation** in /api/data/health: per-symbol COST-BASIS check (ours vs
  shares x avgPrice, flag >max($50,2%)) + advisory global CASH IDENTITY (deposits +
  sells - buys + income vs live cash, caveats listed). Settings panel renders both.
- **E2E on Andrew's file**: 1,303 fills/0 bad rows, all 3 splits paired (PPCB ends at
  EXACTLY 587 shares = Schwab's own post-split count), 105 shorts + 33,205 cover-shares
  netted to a fully-closed short book, ZERO oversold across 2 years, 769 closed trades.
  Christian regression: re-import 0 added; his live app had already auto-upgraded all
  33 CSV rows to API fidelity (group-eviction proven in production).

# WAVE 21 (FIELD FEEDBACK) — EXECUTED 2026-07-06, shipped v0.23.0

(v0.22.1 hotfix preceded this: Eastern trade dates + totals-rule dedup + heal_ledger —
see CHANGELOG.) This wave, from Christian's live report on Andrew's account:

- **W21-2 Per-ticker rule overrides** — `config_store.get/set_symbol_overrides`
  (app_setting `symbol_rules:{account}`, no migration) + pure `apply_symbol_override`
  (frozen-dataclass replace: sell mode/value + dip_scale 0.1–3.0 scaling every
  ladder drop). Applied per-symbol in build_dashboard + build_position_detail (so
  signals/triggers/ladder/projections all follow); `has_rules` row marker (amber
  diamond); `rules_override` in the detail payload; GET/POST /api/symbol-rules;
  `TickerRules` editor on PositionDetail. 6 unit tests; live-verified numerically
  (WIX +5% sell = exact; 50% dip depth raised the trigger 41.10 -> 45.01).
- **W21-3 Activity profit column** — build_activity now reads the FILL LEDGER (full
  imported history, not just API-era audit events) and sums CompletedTrade.profit
  per period; Profit column + Realized Profit card.
- **W21-1 Select clipping** — global `select.field { height:auto !important }` in
  ui.css (fixed 28px heights clipped text at Windows DPI scaling).
- **W21-4 Basis messaging** — basis_diffs carry `count_matches`; when share counts
  match Schwab the gap is labeled a LIFO-vs-tax-lot-election lot-accounting note
  (informational), not "missing data". (INMB investigated: reconstruction was
  CORRECT — deepest lot exactly the expected 10/07 1,006 @ 1.9899.)

# WAVE 22 (CASH IDENTITY & POLISH) — EXECUTED 2026-07-06, shipped v0.24.0/0.24.1

From the live cash-residual question ($33.5k on Andrew's margin account):
- **Airtight cash identity** — short activity stored in fill_record (sides SSEL/BCOV,
  excluded from the long-only projection via load_fills) + counted in trading_net; new
  other-cash log (`ledger.import_other_cash_csv`: margin interest, div adjustments, cash
  in lieu, awards, distributions, and PER-TRADE FEES from the Fees column — all deduped);
  actual = cash MINUS margin debt. Residual collapsed 33.5k → ~$20 (post-import), all
  named components in the health tooltip. (v0.24.1 added the exact fee capture.)
- **Dashboard sorting** — click-to-sort every column (desc→asc→default), persisted,
  applied before ETF nesting so children travel with their parent.
- **Peak-capital ROI** — return % divides by the MAX cumulative net contribution (most of
  your own money ever in at once), immune to out-and-back-in cycling; XIRR stays headline.
- Removed the Profit-factor card from Trades.

# WAVE 23 (POLISH BACKLOG) — EXECUTED 2026-07-06, shipped v0.25.0

The long-deferred polish queue:
- **W23-1 Account label in print headers** — `AccountStamp` (LedgerUI) fetches accounts +
  profiles, renders "Account …719 · MARGIN · Profile: Andrew" in the Ledger + Trades
  print blocks; degrades to nothing when unresolved.
- **W23-2 Bell type icons** — per-row glyph in the notification feed (! alert / ▸ trigger /
  ✓ fill), color-coded; `inferKind` from `kind` else alert_id/message. Emoji-free.
- **W23-3 Dashboard note preview on hover** — backend adds truncated `note_preview` to the
  row; `NoteDot` shows a themed hover popover with the text.
- **W23-4 Small-fixes #13** — "Saved"/"unsaved" inline state on the position note;
  projected-ladder suggested-shares comma-formatted; empty states already friendly.
- Verified live vs a DB copy (note tooltip, bell icons, sorting-with-nesting); 131 backend
  + 21 frontend tests.

# =============================================================================
# PHASE 4 — "READY FOR OTHERS" (planned 2026-07-06, full-app pass)
# =============================================================================
# Source: whole-app review (frontend + backend surveys + 23 waves of field history).
# State of the app: feature-complete for Christian's daily flow; data integrity
# proven on two real accounts; deferred backlog empty. What's left clusters into
# four themes, ordered by the project's north star (someone like his dad could
# start using it) and then by daily-driver value.
#
# App health snapshot at planning time:
#   GOOD: zero TODOs, no native dialogs, tabular-nums everywhere, no interval
#   leaks, all loading/empty/error states covered, 131 backend + 21 frontend
#   tests on the pure logic, perf grade A (1s dashboard cadence is cached).
#   DEBT: ledger.py 1544 lines (8 concerns), main.py 1358 (~108 endpoints),
#   Settings.tsx 874, Notifications.tsx ~630; Notification table has NO retention
#   (audit_event does); no logging framework (53 print()s, 35 bare excepts);
#   zero endpoint-level tests; resync churns ~30 rows/cycle re-adding API fills
#   that heal keeps evicting; native title tooltips inconsistent with the two
#   custom popovers; a11y B+ (icon-only buttons title-only, no aria-live on
#   async saves, popovers don't return focus).

# WAVE 24 — ONBOARDING & CONNECTION (the "dad" wave)
# EXECUTED as v0.26.0 (2026-07-06). What shipped:
#   W24-1 FirstRun.tsx — 4-step live-checking setup guide on the dashboard
#     (connect / account+trading / history import / rules), steps tick off from
#     /auth/status + /accounts + /config + /data/health on a 30s poll, "Defaults
#     are fine" accepts step 4, dismissible, self-retires when complete,
#     Settings > Setup guide brings it back (resetFirstRun).
#   W24-2 _maybe_reauth_nudge() in main.py — soon(≤2d)/today(≤1d)/expired ladder
#     off token_status() in the 60s liveness prober; one bell/phone notification
#     per stage per token issuance (rank-escalation dedup in app_setting
#     "reauth_nudge" = "{issued}|{rank}"; new issued_at re-arms). ReauthButton
#     gained autoStart; AuthBanner auto-opens the flow once per session when
#     expired at launch (sessionStorage "reauth_autopen"). 6 unit tests
#     (tests/test_reauth_nudge.py) cover the ladder.
#   W24-3 demo chip in App.tsx — the old plain-text demo note upgraded to a
#     labeled DEMO strip (tag + copy + inline Connect Schwab button) above the
#     view content on every tab.
#   Verified on a tokenless live-DB copy: guide showed 2/4 with correct states,
#   auto-open fired once per session, demo chip + dismiss/reset round-trip all
#   good; 137 backend + 21 frontend tests, tsc + vite build clean.

## W24-1 — First-run experience
No onboarding exists today: a fresh install drops into an empty demo dashboard.
Build a first-run checklist card (shown when no token AND no fills): 1. Connect
Schwab (opens the existing Reauth flow — desktop auto-captures the redirect),
2. Pick your trading account + enable trading, 3. Import your history (one CSV —
the Data health import), 4. Set your rules (link to Rules tab; defaults shown).
Steps check off as completed (probe existing endpoints); dismissible; reappears
from Settings. Pure frontend + one tiny status endpoint if needed.

## W24-2 — Proactive re-auth nudges
The 7-day Schwab refresh token dies silently; the banner only shows once you look.
Add: a desktop/phone notification at 2 days and on the morning of expiry ("Schwab
connection expires today — one click to renew"), fired from the existing auth
probe loop through post_system_notification (respects category prefs). On app
launch with an EXPIRED token, auto-open the reauth dialog instead of waiting for
the user to find the banner.

## W24-3 — Demo-state clarity
When not connected, every tab should carry one consistent, quiet "Demo data —
connect Schwab" chip that links to the reauth flow (today it's inconsistent
between tabs). Small, copy-level work.

# WAVE 25 — TRADER CONVENIENCES (the daily-driver wave)
# EXECUTED as v0.27.0 (2026-07-07). What shipped:
#   W25-1 replace_order() in orders.py + PUT /api/orders/{id} — uses Schwab's
#     NATIVE cancel-and-replace (atomic at the broker; never orderless mid-swap,
#     strictly better than the planned place-then-cancel). Hard guards: selected
#     trading-enabled account only, single-leg working LIMIT only, BUY/SELL only,
#     nothing-changed refused. Soft rails re-applied to the NEW terms: fat-finger,
#     BUY notional, no-quote fail-closed, partial-fill acknowledgment; SELL-held
#     fail-closed check NOT confirm-overridable. place_order untouched.
#     EditOrderModal in Orders.tsx (prefilled qty/price, needs_confirm Back /
#     Replace-anyway flow). 12 unit tests (tests/test_replace_order.py).
#   W25-2 working_summary() → /api/orders/working-count now returns
#     {count, by_symbol}; App polls 30s and passes by_symbol to DashboardTable,
#     which renders an amber "N working" tag next to the ticker; clicking it
#     opens Orders pre-filtered to that symbol (Orders gained a filter box +
#     initialFilter prop; manual nav to Orders clears the filter).
#   W25-3 /api/accounts entries gained day_profit (sum of per-position
#     currentDayProfitLoss) + invested (longMarketValue). "All accounts" button
#     beside the picker (shown when >1 account) opens a read-only rollup modal:
#     per-account cards (value / day profit / cash / positions, restricted
#     labeled) + combined totals band; clicking a card switches accounts.
#   Verified E2E on a scratch live-DB copy with the broker layer stubbed
#   (fake working orders + fake accounts): marker → filtered Orders deep link,
#   Edit modal fail-closed confirm → Replace anyway → success toast, rollup
#   totals math correct. 149 backend + 21 frontend tests, tsc + build clean.

## W25-1 — Modify a working order (cancel + replace)
Orders tab only cancels today; changing a resting limit means cancel + manually
re-place. Add an Edit button on WORKING orders: change limit price and/or qty in
a small modal -> place the replacement through the guarded place_order rails,
then cancel the original only after the replacement is accepted (never be
orderless mid-swap). Money-path: full review + confirm, same as OrderTicket.

## W25-2 — Pending-order awareness on the dashboard
You can double-place a rung today because rows don't show resting orders. Add a
small "working" marker (count) on any dashboard row with open orders for that
symbol (source: the working-orders fetch already polled for the nav badge,
cached ~30s). Marker links to the Orders tab filtered to that symbol.

## W25-3 — All-accounts rollup
Christian now runs 3+ accounts (personal, LLC, Andrew's). Add a compact
"All accounts" view: per-account cards (value, day profit, positions, cash) +
combined totals. Read-only aggregation over the existing per-account endpoints;
respects profiles. Entry: a row in the account picker or a small nav item.

# WAVE 26 — ANALYTICS DEPTH (the delight wave)
# EXECUTED as v0.28.0 (2026-07-07). What shipped:
#   W26-1 PLCalendar.tsx — Monday-first month grid off /ledger/activity?grain=day,
#     cell tint = alpha-scaled --pos/--neg by |profit| vs the month's max, today
#     outlined, month nav + month total, hover tooltip with profit/bought/sold.
#     Click a traded day → Ledger switches to Trades scoped to that single day
#     (tradesScope state in Ledger.tsx; LedgerTrades gained initialScope + key
#     remount; switching sub-tabs clears the scope).
#   W26-2 compute_streaks / compute_drawdown / _best_worst_periods in ledger.py
#     (pure; zero-profit closes break streaks; drawdown None under 2 points,
#     current_dd clamped ≥0). build_trades response gained streaks / periods /
#     drawdown (DailyBalance scoped like the trades). StreakStats strip on the
#     Trades sub-tab (worst day/week only shown when actually negative). 10 unit
#     tests (tests/test_streaks_drawdown.py).
#   W26-3 SymbolReport in LedgerTrades.tsx — "By symbol" rows are now expandable
#     (aria-expanded, keyboard-operable): fetches /ledger/trades?symbol=X within
#     the current scope; closes count, win rate W/L, total P/L, avg hold, best
#     streak, cumulative sparkline + 8 most recent closes.
#   Verified on a live-DB copy (Christian: streak 14 running, best day +$482.92
#   2025-12-23, calendar tints match real July days, day-click scopes Trades,
#   IREN report 7 closes 100%). 159 backend + 21 frontend tests, tsc + build clean.

## W26-1 — Daily P/L calendar heatmap
Month-grid heatmap of realized profit per day (data already exists via
CompletedTrade / the Activity endpoint at grain=day). Green/red intensity,
hover for the day's numbers, click -> Trades filtered to that day. Lives as a
third element on Ledger -> Activity.

## W26-2 — Streaks & drawdown stats
On Trades: longest win/loss streak, best/worst day and week, and max drawdown +
current drawdown computed from the daily_balance equity series (shown on the
equity curve). Pure computation + display; unit-test the math.

## W26-3 — Per-symbol mini-report
Expand the Trades "By symbol" rows: click a symbol -> its closed-trade history,
win rate over time, avg hold, total P/L sparkline. Reuses build_trades with the
existing symbol filter.

# WAVE 27 — ENGINE ROOM (internals & hardening)

## W27-1 — Notification retention + app_setting caps
Mirror the audit-log pruning for the Notification table (e.g. 180 days / newest
2000). Cap the uncapped app_setting JSON blobs (notes per account, other_cash
rows) with sane limits + oldest-first trimming.

## W27-2 — Logging framework
Replace print() with std logging: rotating file handler in the data dir
(app.log, ~2MB x 3), console in dev. Surface the last ~50 WARNING+ lines in
Settings -> Diagnostics ("Recent errors"). Then audit the 35 bare `except
Exception:` sites — each either logs with context or narrows its exception type.

## W27-3 — Backend splits (no behavior change)
ledger.py (1544) -> ledger/ package: analytics.py (historic/projection/trades/
activity), income.py (dividends/cashflows/other_cash), settings_store.py
(signal rules/etf links/notes), snapshots.py. main.py (~108 endpoints) ->
APIRouter modules by domain (auth, accounts, trading, ledger, data, config).
Tests must stay green untouched; import shims preserve `from . import ledger`.

## W27-4 — Frontend splits + tooltip/a11y pass
Split Settings.tsx (874) into section files and Notifications.tsx (~630) into
feed/activity/alerts children. Introduce one shared <Hint> tooltip component
(the NoteDot/cash-check popover pattern) and adopt it for the info-dense spots;
keep native title elsewhere. A11y: aria-labels on icon-only buttons, aria-live
on async saves, focus-return on popover close.

## W27-5 — Resync churn fix + endpoint smoke tests
upsert_api_fills re-adds partial API fills each cycle that heal then re-evicts
(~30 rows/resync churn on Andrew's account). Skip inserting API fills whose
(day, symbol, side) group is currently CSV-owned (totals rule says CSV wins).
Add FastAPI TestClient smoke tests against a temp SQLite DB: /health, dashboard,
import-csv round-trip, symbol-rules round-trip, bulk plans (read-only) — the
first endpoint-level coverage.

# Not planned (considered, rejected for now):
# - Tax-lot method matching Schwab's election (high effort, low signal — the
#   LIFO-vs-election note on the health panel already explains the difference).
# - Mobile/web remote access (big surface; phone notifications already cover
#   the away-from-desk case).
# - Order automation beyond one-click confirm (violates human-in-the-loop).
